# it-k8s-gitops

## Push-based GitOps-Kubernetes (fluxcd/flux2-managed) on top of Proxmox VE cluster + Unraid VMs [@Home](https://github.com/nonkronk/rumah-assistant)

Highly opinionated setup on deploying HA [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/).

![Proxmox VE + Unraid](https://storage.googleapis.com/tristian.id/Proxmox%20VE%20cluster%20%2B%20Unraid%20server.png)

The purpose here is to showcase how you can deploy an entire Kubernetes cluster and show it off to the world using the [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) tool [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/). When completed, your Git repository will be driving the state of your Kubernetes cluster. In addition with the help of the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops), [Terraform](https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops) and [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) SOPS integrations you'll be able to commit Age encrypted secrets to your public repo.

## Overview

## 👋 Introduction

Stacks:

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - SSL certificates - with Cloudflare DNS challenge
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - CNI (container network interface)
- [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server) - REST Server Tests (Echo-Server) API (useful for debugging HTTP issues)
- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps tool for deploying manifests from the `cluster` directory
- [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari) - start page with ingress discovery
- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) - layer 2 load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane
- [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) - default storage class provided by k3s
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - bare metal load balancer
- [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) - restart pods when Kubernetes `configmap` or `secret` changes
- [reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) - mirror `configmap`s or `secret`s to other Kubernetes namespaces
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) - automate upgrading k3s
- [traefik](https://traefik.io) - ingress controller

For provisioning:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) - this is a pretty universal operating system that supports running all kinds of home related workloads in Kubernetes
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) - this will be used to provision the Ubuntu operating system to be ready for Kubernetes and also to install k3s
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) - in order to help with the DNS settings this will be used to provision an already existing Cloudflare domain and DNS settings

## 📂 Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore
